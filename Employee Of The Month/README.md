## Brief project background
Employee of the Month was created with 7 classmates during a 7-week project course at Yrgo in the winter of 2022-2023. My primary responsibilities were developing weapon upgrades and features, as well as a local co-op lobby where up to 4 players could join, choose characters and start correctly. All upgrades were designed to be combinable and work together, allowing for "ultimate attacks" with specific combinations. Working on this game taught me a great deal about game design, graphics, and the game development process.


## My contributions to this project

### Weapon upgrades

<!--- My main responsability was developing and maintaining the networking part together with another programmer. This was a pretty big challenge as neither of us had tried multiplayer in Unreal Engine but it turned out to be both a buggy and fun experience. My favorite bug was when the host could kill all clients no problem, but if the clients tried to kill the host they would instantly die themselves. A client shooting another client resulted in both dying :) <br>
This was of course fixed as we dove deeper into the networking nest of Unreal. <br>
