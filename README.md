## [The Prisoning: Fletcher's Quest](https://github.com/MikaelahJ/Portfolio/tree/main/The%20Prisoning%20-%20Fletchers%20Quest) <- LEARN MORE!

> For 6 months, I worked as an intern at Elden Pixels in Gothenburg. I was involved from the start on The Prisoning: Fletcher's Quest, a new project in Unity where I had significant responsibility for developing enemies and bosses. During this internship, I created around 20 enemies and 3 bosses from scratch, which was a super fun challenge to program. In addition to working on enemies, I spent a lot of time developing both in-depth systems and various gameplay systems related to enemies and bosses, as well as unique sequence breaks and cutscenes to give the game its distinctive feel. Currently, I donâ€™t know the release date, but there may be an opportunity to test a demo if you're interested. :)

## [Entity](https://github.com/MikaelahJ/Portfolio/tree/main/Entity) <- LEARN MORE!
> Entity was a 7-week project during the spring of 2023 where my team developed a LAN multiplayer FPS in Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprints) set in a dark environment with various light-related abilities. I, together with another programmer, primarily handled the networking aspect and integrated the other team members' features to function and replicate for all players simultaneously. I also worked extensively on developing our VFX and ensuring they displayed correctly for all players.
