## Who am I and what is this?

Hello! I'm a game programmer recently graduated from Yrgo in Gothenburg, Sweden. This page was made to more clearly view and show the projects I've worked on over the years. I have 3+ years of experience with C# as well as a couple of years working in both Unity and Unreal Engine 5 (both Blueprints & C++) as well as some experience in Godot with GDScript. I'm also currently taking a course in C++ to get a better understanding of how it works under the hood.

For me, programming is all about two things: the problem solving and getting that kick after a particularly difficult problem, along with the satisfaction of constantly learning new things and using them to improve or create something I've never done before. My approach to game development is mostly just "Go with the flow and follow the fun". Why fight against what makes the game fun? Games should be fun and interesting to play, so that's always the direction I aim for in my work.

Below is a preview of my previous projects. Click the titles to learn more about my contributions to each game. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat, I'd love to connect! :) <br>

## [The Prisoning: Fletcher's Quest](https://github.com/MikaelahJ/Portfolio/tree/main/The%20Prisoning%20-%20Fletchers%20Quest) <- LEARN MORE!

> For 6 months, I worked as an intern at Elden Pixels in Gothenburg. I was involved from the start on The Prisoning: Fletcher's Quest, a new project in Unity where I had significant responsibility for developing enemies and bosses. During this internship, I created around 20 enemies and 3 bosses from scratch, which was a super fun challenge to program. In addition to working on enemies, I spent a lot of time developing both in-depth systems and various gameplay systems related to enemies and bosses, as well as unique sequence breaks and cutscenes to give the game its distinctive feel. Currently, I don’t know the release date, but there may be an opportunity to test a demo if you're interested. :)

## [Scorched Fur](https://github.com/MikaelahJ/Scorched-Fur-Master-thesis/tree/main) <- LEARN MORE!
> Scorched Fur is my higher vocational education degree project for Yrgo - Game Creator Programmer, where I, along with two other programmers, chose to create a 'vertical slice' with a particular focus on emulating the 'souls-like' genre. For me this project had two main goals. The first was to create a vertical slice / demo of a soulslike combat game in Unreal Engine 5. The second goal was to learn C++ and its implementation in UE5. My responsibility was to develop the boss's behavior, for which I built a custom state machine to dynamically select attacks. A major challenge was the absence of an animator in the team, which forced me to dive deeper into UE5's animation system to blend and modify animations, an experience that turned out to be unexpectedly enjoyable. Developing and implementing dynamic AI and NPC behaviors is a major interest of mine, and this project has definitely strengthened that interest.

## [Entity](https://github.com/MikaelahJ/Portfolio/tree/main/Entity) <- LEARN MORE!
> Entity was a 7-week project during the spring of 2023 where my team developed a LAN multiplayer FPS in Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprints) set in a dark environment with various light-related abilities. I, together with another programmer, primarily handled the networking aspect and integrated the other team members' features to function and replicate for all players simultaneously. I also worked extensively on developing our VFX and ensuring they displayed correctly for all players.

## [Employee Of The Month](https://github.com/MikaelahJ/Portfolio/tree/main/Employee%20Of%20The%20Month) <- LEARN MORE!
> Employee of the Month was created with 7 classmates during a 7-week project course at Yrgo. My primary responsibilities were developing weapon upgrades and features, as well as a local co-op lobby where up to 4 players could join, choose characters and start correctly. All upgrades were designed to be combinable and work together, allowing for "ultimate attacks" with specific combinations. Working on this game taught me a great deal about game design, graphics, and the game development process.

# My Educations

### Yrgo / Game Creator Programmer
> 2022-2024, Gothenburg, Sweden

Recently graduated from a program in game programming and game design. During my studies, I developed skills in working both independently and in larger teams, and deepened my problem-solving abilities. I primarily worked with C# in Unity but also delved into C++ and Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5 across several projects during the course. The program also includes a 6-month internship, which I completed at Elden Pixels in Gothenburg.
